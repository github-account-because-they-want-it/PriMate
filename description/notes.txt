Usage
======

1- To add a new subject, append a new object `{"name":"mysubject"}` to the end of the outer list `[]`
2- To order subject conditions, reorder their names within their containing list.
   The subject conditions are added automatically for each subject after starting a trial for that subject.
   But they can be added manually. Only the "name" property is necessary.
